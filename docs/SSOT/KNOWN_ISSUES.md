# Known Issues & Technical Gaps

**Status:** Living backlog (pre-launch and ongoing).  
**Language:** English only.

Track **bugs**, **regressions**, and **gaps** that should be fixed (or explicitly accepted before release).

This is **not** the same as:

| File | Owns |
|------|------|
| [TECHNICAL_DEBT.md](./TECHNICAL_DEBT.md) | Intentional **deferrals** (What / Why / Revisit-when) |
| [CODE QUALITY.md](./CODE%20QUALITY.md) §6 | Small **architecture refactors** (`[PENDING REFACTOR]`) |
| GitHub Issues / PRs | Execution, discussion, assignees |

When a spec defers a feature by choice, log it in **TECHNICAL_DEBT.md**. When something is broken or missing and should be fixed, log it here.

---

## How to use

1. **Add** a row under the right priority table (or create a subsection).
2. **Link** spec, PR, or file path when known.
3. **Update status** when work starts or ships; move done items to [Resolved](#resolved) with date + PR.
4. **Do not** duplicate TECHNICAL_DEBT deferrals here unless there is an active bug (e.g. deferred feature shipped broken).

### Fields (per item)

| Field | Values |
|-------|--------|
| **ID** | `KI-###` (increment) |
| **Priority** | P0 (launch blocker) · P1 (soon) · P2 (polish) |
| **Status** | `open` · `in_progress` · `accepted` · `resolved` |
| **Area** | `mobile` · `web` · `supabase` · `i18n` · `ci` · `infra` |
| **SRS** | `REQ-*` if product-related |

## P0 — Launch blockers

| ID | Status | Area | Issue | Notes / fix direction |
|----|--------|------|-------|------------------------|
| KI-001 | resolved | mobile | **Invite redemption blocked during post-login onboarding** | Fixed 2026-06-02: `useAuthenticatedInviteRedemption` in gate + `pendingNavigation` flushed in `AppNavigator`. |
| KI-002 | resolved | mobile | **`fetchGroups` failure skips post-login onboarding** | Fixed 2026-06-02: fetch errors route to `create` gate (`lib/authenticatedGateResolve.ts`). |
| KI-003 | open | infra | **`assetlinks.json` has empty `sha256_cert_fingerprints` array** | Live at `https://kupa.pro/.well-known/assetlinks.json` returns `[]`. Until populated with the SHA-256 of the Play App Signing key (post first EAS production build), Android App Links won't auto-verify — `kupa.pro/i/*` and `/g/*` URLs open the browser instead of the app. Fingerprint is visible in Play Console → Setup → App signing after first upload. Update via Supabase Edge Function (the endpoint is served from prod project `jfqxjjjbpxbwwvoygahu`). |
| KI-004 | resolved | mobile | **9 TypeScript errors block `tsc --noEmit`** | Fixed 2026-06-02: added `isAdmin: false` to 4 User fixtures; removed invalid `role` from `mockGetGroupMembers.mockResolvedValueOnce` fixtures; chained `.then(() => undefined)` on `i18n.init()` to discharge the TFunction return; type-erased the `globalThis.crypto` polyfill via narrowed local alias. Also fixed a separate merge conflict in `hooks/queries/keys.ts` (both `adminPlatformMetrics` and `exchangeRates` keys preserved) and a stale `FriendBalance` fixture in `__tests__/lib/collectProfileFxCurrencies.test.ts` (added missing `name`/`isActive`/`sharedGroupIds`). `tsc --noEmit` now exits 0 for both `apps/mobile` and `packages/shared`. |
| KI-005 | partial | supabase | **Production missing migrations vs dev + missing prereq for `admin_platform_metrics`** | Prod (`jfqxjjjbpxbwwvoygahu`) has 5 migrations through `20260602130000`. Dev has 7 (`+ 20260602110734_revoke_sessions_on_delete`, `+ 20260602140000_admin_platform_metrics`). Auto-deployed on `main` push via `deploy-production.yml`. **Critical prereq filled 2026-06-02:** `20260602140000_admin_platform_metrics.sql` references `groups.last_activity_at` and `group_user_archive` — neither exists in prod (they live in the non-migration `supabase/group-archive.sql` that was MCP-applied to dev). Without the prereq, prod deploy would fail. Resolution: created `20260602135000_group_archive.sql` as a migration copy of `group-archive.sql` (idempotent — `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`). Verified dev signatures match. **Remaining:** dry-run the chain (`20260602135000` → `140000` → `150000`) against a Supabase branch before merging dev → main. |
| KI-006 | partial | supabase | **17 `SECURITY DEFINER` functions executable by `anon` role** | Surgical fix added 2026-06-02 as migration `20260602150000_lockdown_security_definer.sql`. Revokes `anon` from 18 user/admin RPCs (`delete_my_account`, `get_my_open_balances`, `get_user_dashboard`, `get_user_balance_summary`, `get_activity_unread_count`, `get_group_messages`, `create/update/delete_group_message`, `accept/reject/send_friend_request`, `remove_friend`, `search_users`, `mark_activity_seen`, `admin_list_deleted_accounts`, `admin_restore_deleted_account`, `restore_deleted_account`) and grants only `authenticated`. Trigger-only functions (`emit_*_activity_events` × 5 + `check_email_not_deleted`) get full revoke — verified all 6 are wired to active triggers via `pg_trigger`; SECURITY DEFINER lets them fire as the owner. RLS helpers (`is_group_member`, `is_group_creator`, `is_caller_active`, `is_app_admin`) intentionally untouched. Migration dry-run validated against dev DB. **Remaining:** advisor will still flag the `authenticated` row (`authenticated_security_definer_function_executable`) — acceptable for now since these functions either need authenticated access (user RPCs) or check `is_app_admin()` internally (admin RPCs). |
| ~~KI-007~~ | retracted | mobile | ~~Android release build type points at debug keystore~~ | **Retracted 2026-06-02:** Not a blocker. `apps/mobile/android/` is fully gitignored (`.gitignore` line `/android`). EAS Build runs `expo prebuild` from scratch and injects the production keystore via `eas.json` credentials, overriding any local template. The local `signingConfig signingConfigs.debug` only affects `expo run:android --variant release` locally, which isn't used for store submissions. To permanently override the template would require an Expo config plugin — deferred. |

## P1 — Fix soon (post-launch acceptable only if tested)

| ID | Status | Area | Issue | Notes / fix direction |
|----|--------|------|-------|------------------------|
| KI-010 | open | mobile | **No automated tests for onboarding gate** | Coverage exists for `onboardingStorage`, `platformAlert`, `platformShare`; missing tests for `AuthenticatedAppGate`, `OnboardingPreAuthFlow`, `OnboardingCreateGroupScreen`, skip/create/error paths. |
| KI-011 | open | web | **Toast renders outside phone frame when authenticated** | In `App.tsx`, logged-in path places `Toast` outside `WebFrame`; logged-out path keeps it inside. Success/error toasts may span full browser width. |
| KI-012 | open | web | **`WebAlertHost` backdrop dismiss ignores Cancel** | Tapping outside modal calls `dismiss()` without `cancel` button `onPress`. Affects 3+ button alerts (e.g. receipt picker in `AddExpenseScreen`). File: `components/WebAlertHost.tsx`. |
| KI-013 | open | i18n | **Plural keys missing in `en.json`** | 16 `_many` / `_two` keys present in `he.json` but not `en` — risk of raw keys or wrong pluralization in English. |
| KI-014 | open | ci | **Jest worker does not exit cleanly** | `worker process has failed to exit gracefully` after full mobile test run; root cause likely in `jest-setup.ts` (mocks for Supabase / safe-area / toast leak timers / listeners; no `afterEach(() => { jest.clearAllMocks(); jest.clearAllTimers(); })`). Investigate open handles via `--detectOpenHandles`. |
| KI-015 | open | ci | **CI runs lint + jest but no `tsc --noEmit`** | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` only runs `npm run lint` and `npm test`. 9 type errors (KI-004) merged silently. Add a `typecheck` job: `npm run -ws --if-present tsc -- --noEmit`. |
| ~~KI-016~~ | retracted | mobile | ~~5 i18n keys missing~~ | **Retracted 2026-06-02:** false positive from initial audit. All 5 keys (`balances.expenseCount`, `balances.paymentsToSettle`, `groups.expense.splitBetweenCount`, `groups.expense.toNPeople`, `groups.memberCount`) exist as pluralized forms (`_one`/`_other`/`_two`/`_many`) which i18next resolves via the `{count}` interpolator. Confirmed by dumping both locale files. |
| KI-017 | open | mobile | **`activity.service.ts` and `groups.service.ts` mix RPC-error-message string matching with structured handling** | E.g. `groups.service.ts:224` `error.message?.includes('has_balance')`; `deepLinks.service.ts:128-140` matches `'invite_not_found'` / `'cannot_self_invite'` strings. Brittle: any Postgres locale change or error wrapper breaks UX. RPCs should return a structured `{ ok, error_code }` object. |
| KI-018 | open | mobile | **`groups.service.ts` (641 LOC) and `messages.service.ts` have zero unit tests** | Both touched in recent commits (`8490d7b`, `2a368c3`). High blast radius — every screen uses `groups.service`. Add at minimum mocked-Supabase tests for `fetchGroups`, `getGroupBalances`, `getGroupDebts`, `fetchMessages`. |
| KI-019 | open | mobile | **`createExpense` non-atomic: expense row + N split rows inserted sequentially without rollback** | `services/expenses.service.ts:129–152`. If a split insert fails mid-loop, the expense row orphans without splits. Move to a SECURITY DEFINER RPC that wraps both inserts in a single transaction. |
| KI-030 | open | supabase | **`get_group_messages` signature drift between dev and prod** | Dev has `(uuid, integer, timestamptz)` — added manually via MCP, not in any migration or `schema.sql`. Prod has `(uuid, integer)` — matches `cost-share-app/supabase/group-messages.sql`. The 3-param version in dev has no source-of-truth file. Either (a) add a migration that introduces the `p_before` parameter so prod catches up, or (b) drop the 3-param dev override. `20260602150000_lockdown_security_definer.sql` works around this with a DO block that revokes/grants on whatever signature exists. |

## P2 — Polish / tech hygiene

| ID | Status | Area | Issue | Notes / fix direction |
|----|--------|------|-------|------------------------|
| KI-020 | open | i18n | **`settleUp.swap` only in `en.json`** | Key unused in code today; add to `he.json` or remove from `en.json`. |
| KI-021 | open | mobile | **Language change in Settings does not reload app** | First launch seeds RTL via `Updates.reloadAsync()`; `changeLanguage` from Settings/Login only calls `forceRTL`. Most UI uses `useRtlLayout`; some native RTL may lag until restart. File: `i18n/index.ts`. |
| KI-022 | open | docs | **Onboarding spec vs implementation: 3 vs 4 feature slides** | Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-01-onboarding-flow-design.md` says 3 slides; app has 4. Align spec or product, not a runtime bug. |
| KI-023 | resolved | mobile | **`console.log` in `initializeLanguage`** | Fixed 2026-06-02: wrapped both calls (`i18n/index.ts:118,136`) in `if (__DEV__)`. |
| KI-024 | accepted | mobile | **No “replay onboarding” in Settings** | Documented as not v1 in onboarding spec. |
| KI-025 | open | mobile | **RTL violations: `marginLeft`/`marginRight` and `textAlign:'left'` hardcoded in 10 component sites** | `components/CurrencyPicker.tsx:123`, `components/UnequalSplitPanel.tsx:169`, `components/AddMembersSheet.tsx:251`, `components/groupDetail/MemberStack.tsx:68`, `components/expenseV2/StackedAvatarGroup.tsx:25`, `components/FeedRowCard.tsx` (4×), `components/expenseV2/MemberPickerPopup.tsx`. Use `marginStart`/`marginEnd` and conditional `textAlign` (LegalDocumentSheet.tsx pattern). |
| KI-026 | open | mobile | **`toLocaleDateString()` called without `locale` argument** | `screens/expenses/ExpenseDetailScreen.tsx` and `screens/admin/AdminDeletedUsersScreen.tsx` — dates render in OS locale, not app language. Pass `i18n.language` (or `he-IL`/`en-US`). Reference correct pattern: `screens/balances/SettleUpListScreen.tsx:285`. |
| ~~KI-027~~ | retracted | supabase | ~~Prod auth: leaked password protection disabled~~ | **Retracted 2026-06-02:** N/A — the app uses Google OAuth exclusively (`auth.service.ts` only calls `signInWithOAuth` with provider `google`; no `signInWithPassword`/`signUpWithPassword` anywhere). Supabase advisor flags it generically but there are no passwords to protect. Revisit only if email/password sign-in is ever introduced. |
| KI-028 | open | supabase | **iOS AASA appID malformed: `.com.kupapay.mobile`** | `https://kupa.pro/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` returns `{"applinks":{"apps":[],"details":[{"appID":".com.kupapay.mobile",…}]}}`. Missing the Apple Team ID prefix — should be `TEAMID.com.kupapay.mobile`. iOS Universal Links will silently fail. Not blocking Google Play beta but blocks first iOS beta. |
| ~~KI-029~~ | retracted | mobile | ~~OAuth redirect URL logged in production~~ | **Retracted 2026-06-02:** false positive. Line 171 is inside an `if (__DEV__) { … }` block (line 170 opens the guard). All `console.info` calls in `auth.service.ts` are guarded; the lone `console.warn` (line 249) is on a real error path. |

## Pre-launch manual QA (checklist)

Use alongside automated tests before store / production cutover:

- [ ] Invite link → sign up → post-login onboarding → lands in correct group
- [ ] New user, airplane mode on first open after login → onboarding gate behavior
- [ ] Web: share invite, export group HTML, multi-button alerts
- [ ] Web: Toast position inside phone frame
- [ ] Hebrew device first launch → RTL reload; language toggle in Settings
- [ ] Skip pre- and post-login onboarding → no infinite loops; empty groups UX OK
- [ ] EAS production env: `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` contains **production** ref (`jfqxjjjbpxbwwvoygahu`), not dev
- [ ] **After first EAS production build:** copy the App Signing key SHA-256 from Play Console → Setup → App signing into the `assetlinks.json` array; verify Android App Links auto-open via `adb shell pm verify-app-links --re-verify com.kupapay.mobile` (KI-003).
- [ ] **Before merging dev → main:** review pending prod migrations `20260602110823_revoke_sessions_on_delete` + `20260602140000_admin_platform_metrics` against prod data (KI-005).
- [ ] **TS gate:** run `npm run tsc -- --noEmit` from `apps/mobile` and confirm 0 errors (KI-004 + KI-015).
