# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) — Kupa

**Status:** Living document (v0.1 — derived from current codebase).  
**Audience:** Humans and AI agents.  
**IDs:** Every requirement uses `REQ-<AREA>-<nn>` for traceability.

**Legend:** ✅ Implemented · 🟡 Partial · ⬜ Planned · ❌ Out of scope (MVP)

## 1. Product summary

Kupa helps groups of people track shared expenses, split costs fairly, see who owes whom, and record settlements (payments between members). Think Splitwise: groups, expenses, splits, balances, settle-up.

**Primary client:** React Native (Expo) mobile app.  
**Backend:** Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage); mobile/web use `@supabase/supabase-js` with RLS.  
**Auth:** Supabase Auth (Google on mobile/web).

## 2. Domain glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Profile** | App user row (`profiles`), 1:1 with `auth.users` |
| **Group** | Shared ledger for a set of members |
| **Expense** | Money spent; one **payer** (`paid_by`); split via **expense_splits** |
| **Split** | Portion each member owes for an expense (sum = expense amount) |
| **Settlement** | Payment from member A to B (reduces debt; not an expense) |
| **Net balance** | `paid − owed + received_settlements − paid_settlements` per user in group |
| **Debt summary** | Simplified “A owes B $X” between pairs (server-calculated) |

Balance formula (authoritative): see `CalculationsService` and [DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE.md](../../DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 4. Business rules (normative)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| BR-01 | Each expense has exactly one payer (`paid_by`). |
| BR-02 | Sum of `expense_splits.amount` for an expense must equal `expenses.amount` (± rounding policy in service). |
| BR-03 | Payer is included in splits (simplifies balance math). |
| BR-04 | Settlements are not expenses; they only adjust balances between two users. |
| BR-05 | Deleted expenses (`is_deleted`) do not affect balances. |
| BR-06 | Only active group members (`group_members.is_active`) participate in new expenses (enforce in services). |
| BR-07 | Soft-deleted groups (`groups.is_active = false`) are hidden from default lists. |

---

## 5. Out of scope (MVP)

- Multi-currency conversion / FX rates
- In-app payment processing (Stripe, etc.)
- Expense approval workflows
- Guest users without auth
- Splitwise import
